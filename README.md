# To-do App - A task-keeping app using JavaScript, Local Storage Webpack and Babel

This project is a To-do App to write and store little notes about to remind you what you need to do. I worked through this project to brush up on my vanilla JavaScript skills, particularly manipulating the DOM and using event listeners.

For this project, I used Webpack which is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser.

I also integrated Babel in order to practise compiling and simplifying code so that the app would work on different browsers.

This is a project I completed as part of Andrew Mead's 'The Modern Javascript Course' on Udemy. This was a 30 hour project to learn and practise the fundamental parts of JavaScript.
